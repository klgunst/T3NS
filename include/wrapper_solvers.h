/**
 * \brief the wrapper for the sparse eigensolvers for finding the lowest
 * algebraic eigenvalues.
 *
 * \param [in,out] vec The initial guess is inputted here and the result is
 * outputted.
 * \param [in] dims The dimension of the sparse problem.
 * \param [out] energy The resulting energy.
 * \param [in] matvec The pointer to the function defining the matrix vector
 * product. This function should take as arguments the incoming vector, the
 * outputted vector and a pointer to data needed.
 * \param [in] data The pointer to a data structure needed for the matrix
 * vector product.
 * \param [in] diagonal An array of diagonal elements of the matrix. When using
 * the conjugate
 * gradient without preconditioner this pointer is set NULL.
 * \param [in] tol Tolerance for the convergence. Convergence criterion is
 * \f$||Ax - \lambda M x|| < tol \f$ for the found vector \f$x\f$ and energy
 * \f$ \lambda \f$.
 * \param [in] max_its The maximum number of iterations.
 * \param [in] solver String that specifies solver to be used. "D" for Davidson.
 * \param [in] davidson_keep The number of vectors to be kept after deflation
 * in the Davidson algorithm.
 * \param [in] davidson_max_vec Number of maximum vectors to be taken into
 * account before deflation is needed in the Davidson algorithm.
